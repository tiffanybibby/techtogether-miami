# Miami Clean Connect

Meet *Miami Cleanup Connect*. Our web application was designed with everyday people in mind. While we may sometimes feel helpless in the fight against climate change and poor environmental practices, we wanted our users to feel in control of the issues affecting their local community. The app allows users, organizations and individuals alike, to coordinate beach cleanup events with ease. Users merely need to sign up or login to gain access to events near them. Here, they can easily sign up with the click of a button. Organizations can post ads for their event, including the date, time, location, and number of volunteers needed.

## Inspiration

When researching Miami, the culture, and the issues the city faces, we noticed that ocean pollution was a major issues with few solutions. Miami is known for its beautiful beaches, but single-use plastics are posing a threat to both the water quality and wildlife. We decided that we could combine our technological skills to help fix this issue, while keeping in mind the unique, rich culture of Miami.

## How We Built It
We used mongodb, node.js, express, html, and css to build our app in Visual Studio Code. We also used Github for version control and collaboration.

## Design Choices
We were insipired by "retro Miami" colors for the UI in creating this app. 

### Figma Prototype

## What's next for Miami Cleanup Connect
In the future, we would love to add other features we came up with during the brainstorming process but were not able to implement in time. For example, our contribution calculator prompts users to take a short survey about their daily habits. The survey, once completed, will return a report highlighting which aspects of ocean pollution they contribute to the most. The summary will include specific ways they can improve each aspect of their lives to live more sustainably.
